# Enso-theme
Theme for the Enso-OS desktop, based on the Arc-theme (horst3180)

Theme-variant-1 is the same theme, but has smaller menu's with separators.
Theme-variant-2 is like variant-1, but uses shadows as borders for dropdown-menu's and context-menu's. These now looks the same accross GTK2 and GTK3
